# MachineLearningFall22

— In this project, we are trying to investigate a
merchandise dataset provided by Kaggle where “Kaggle” is
a franchise for whom we are building a machine learning
model that could predict where should Kaggle open their
new store (Norway, Finland or Sweden?); additionally, we will
also provide what is expected “number of items sold”, and
which store is performing well (KaggleMart or KaggleRama?).
We use a neural network as a regressor for the time-series
dataset. First, we preprocess the dataset based on different
feature combinations to perform exploratory analysis and data
wrangling. After that, we use the refined dataset for two
different learning algorithms. We envisage neural network
working as a regressor should outperform the linear regression
model for this particular dataset. Finally, we plan to perform
hyperparameter tuning and testing and make the final decision
along with the required deliverables. The objective is to find
out which store can perform better by the time forward.
Finally using the correct combinations of all operations and
configurations we came up with the conclusion that Kaggle
Rama is better.

This project is part of ML Class 2022
